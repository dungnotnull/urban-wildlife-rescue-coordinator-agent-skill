# PROJECT-detail.md — Skill 223: urban-wildlife-rescue-coordinator

## Executive Summary

`urban-wildlife-rescue-coordinator` is a professional-grade harness for Claude Code targeting the
**Urban Wildlife Rescue & Rehabilitation** domain. It transforms Claude into a domain-expert that delivers
structured, evidence-backed outputs by combining real-time data aggregation,
recognized domain methods, and academic research into a single orchestrated
workflow ending in a risk/limitation-disclosed recommendation.

---

## Problem Statement

Practitioners in this domain face three structural gaps:
1. **Data fragmentation**: authoritative data scattered across sources.
2. **Methodology gaps**: most advice lacks systematic, evidence-graded methods.
3. **No self-improvement**: static tools don't learn from new research.

This skill addresses all three via real-time aggregation, professional
frameworks, and a continuously-updated knowledge crawl pipeline.

## Target Users & Use Cases

| User | Trigger Example | Skill Response |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Practitioner | "Analyze Urban Wildlife Rescue & Rehabilitation case X" | Full evidenced report |
| Researcher | "What methods apply to Y?" | Method-grounded guidance with citations |
| Decision-maker | "Assess risk/feasibility of Z" | Risk-disclosed assessment with scenarios |
| Learner | "Explain method M in this domain" | Educational framing with evidence |

    ├─► sub-gather-requirements.md  → Clarify the object of analysis, constraints, timeframe, available inputs, target audience, and language before any data fetching.

    ├─► sub-core-analysis.md  → Coordinate urban wildlife rescue: analyze rescue reports, propose safe capture/handling/transport, and recommend rehabilitation or coexistence, grounded in wildlife-vet science.
    ├─► sub-knowledge-updater.md  → Query SECOND-KNOWLEDGE-BRAIN.md for authoritative academic and professional evidence; surface citations with tier labels and flag gaps for the crawl pipeline.
    ├─► sub-advisor.md  → Synthesize all prior analysis into a risk-disclosed conclusion with a full evidence chain and recommended actions.

## Full Sub-Skill Catalog

### 1. `sub-gather-requirements.md`
- **Purpose:** Clarify the object of analysis, constraints, timeframe, available inputs, target audience, and language before any data fetching.
- **Role:** intake specialist for a Urban Wildlife Rescue & Rehabilitation engagement
- **Inputs:** Raw user message + any provided materials/inputs.
- **Outputs:** Structured requirements: {object, scope, timeframe, available_inputs, target_audience, language, analysis_type}.
- **Tools:** - Conversation only (no external tools)
- **Quality Gate:** At least one object of analysis confirmed before proceeding.

### 2. `sub-evidence-collector.md`
- **Purpose:** Fetch authoritative real-time and reference data for the object: current status/parameters, authoritative documents/standards, and recent developments from domain and academic sources.
- **Role:** Urban Wildlife Rescue & Rehabilitation data librarian
- **Inputs:** Requirements object from Step 1.
- **Outputs:** Evidence bundle: {current_data, authoritative_docs, recent_news, reference_benchmarks} with source + date per item.
- **Tools:** - WebSearch, WebFetch (domain + academic sources)
- Read (SECOND-KNOWLEDGE-BRAIN.md for cached benchmarks)
- **Quality Gate:** At least current data + 1 authoritative document retrieved, or a limitation flag if unavailable.

### 3. `sub-core-analysis.md`
- **Purpose:** Coordinate urban wildlife rescue: analyze rescue reports, propose safe capture/handling/transport, and recommend rehabilitation or coexistence, grounded in wildlife-vet science.
- **Role:** urban wildlife rescue & rehabilitation coordinator
- **Inputs:** Rescue report (species/condition/location), rescuer, language.
- **Outputs:** Triage + capture/handling + rehab/release + coordination + scenarios.
- **Tools:** - Image analysis (species ID)
- Read (SECOND-KNOWLEDGE-BRAIN.md)
- WebFetch (IWRC, wildlife vet refs)
- **Quality Gate:** Species ID & triage; safe capture/handling; zoonosis precautions; rehab/release or coexistence decision.

### 4. `sub-knowledge-updater.md`
- **Purpose:** Query SECOND-KNOWLEDGE-BRAIN.md for authoritative academic and professional evidence; surface citations with tier labels and flag gaps for the crawl pipeline.
- **Role:** research librarian for Urban Wildlife Rescue & Rehabilitation
- **Inputs:** Topic keywords from the current analysis.
- **Outputs:** 3-5 knowledge-base citations with Tier labels + flagged gaps.
- **Tools:** - Read (SECOND-KNOWLEDGE-BRAIN.md)
- WebSearch (gap-fill, max 2 queries)
- **Quality Gate:** At least 1 academic/authoritative source surfaced; coverage rating provided.

### 5. `sub-advisor.md`
- **Purpose:** Synthesize all prior analysis into a risk-disclosed conclusion with a full evidence chain and recommended actions.
- **Role:** senior Urban Wildlife Rescue & Rehabilitation advisor
- **Inputs:** Core analysis scorecard + evidence bundle + knowledge-base evidence.
- **Outputs:** Conclusion (one of N declared categories) + scenarios + key risks + evidence chain + remediation + mandatory disclosure.
- **Tools:** - Reasoning / synthesis
- Skill('sub-knowledge-updater') optional
- **Quality Gate:** Conclusion is exactly one of: Rescue Plan Ready / Conditional (vet referral) / Euthanasia/Referral Needed / Inconclusive; disclosure appears before the conclusion.

## E2E Execution Flow

```
1. User invokes /urban-wildlife-rescue-coordinator [query]
2. main.md → sub-gather-requirements → structured requirements
3. sub-evidence-collector → data bundle
4. core analysis sub-skills → scorecard / signal set
5. sub-knowledge-updater → academic evidence entries
6. sub-advisor/synthesizer → final draft
7. main.md Quality Gate → verify, auto-fix, deliver
```

**Error handling:** primary sources fail → fallback chain → knowledge base →
explicit limitation flag; never silently proceed with stale data.

---

## SECOND-KNOWLEDGE-BRAIN Integration

- **Sources crawled:** academic databases + domain RSS + standards docs
- **Crawl config:** `KNOWLEDGE_CONFIG` in `tools/knowledge_updater.py`
- **Dedup:** SHA256 of DOI/URL
- **Scoring:** recency + keyword relevance + citation count

## Quality Gates Definition

Universal gates U1–U6 (see library SKILL-STANDARD.md) plus the domain gates
defined in `skills/main.md`: G1, G2, G3, G4

---

## Test Scenarios

See `tests/test-scenarios.md` for 5+ concrete scenario tests.

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. Domain sub-skills kept separate (distinct methods/data).
2. Authoritative domain sources as primary; global fallback secondary.
3. Disclosure enforced at the quality-gate level, not optional.
4. SECOND-KNOWLEDGE-BRAIN as living memory updated by crawl pipeline.
5. Graceful degradation to knowledge base with explicit limitation flags.
